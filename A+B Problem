Q: Where are the input and the output?

A: Your program shall always read input from stdin (Standard Input) and write output to stdout (Standard Output). For example, you can use 'scanf' in C or 'cin' in C++ to read from stdin, and use 'printf' in C or 'cout' in C++ to write to stdout.

You shall not output any extra data to standard output other than that required by the problem, otherwise you will get a "Wrong Answer".

User programs are not allowed to open and read from/write to files. You will get a "Runtime Error" or a "Wrong Answer" if you try to do so. 

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{int a,b;
 cout<<"please input two integer a,b(0 ≤ a,b ≤ 10):";
 cin>>a>>b;
 cout<<a+b<<endl;
 return 0;
}
